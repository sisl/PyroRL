# Summary

One of the main effects of climate change today is the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires. This reality has led to increased research in wildfire response, particularly with reinforcement learning (RL). However, while much effort has centered around modeling wildfire spread or surveillance, there is a lack of work around wildfire evacuation. To this end, we present Wildfire-Evac, a new RL environment for wildfire evacuation. The environment, which builds upon the Gymnasium API standard, simulates evacuating populated areas through paths from a grid world lit by wildfires. We aim for our work to be the basis of new strategies for wildfire evacuation based on RL methods.
